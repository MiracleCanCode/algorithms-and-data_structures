### `Queue` is a data structure that operates on the principle of "first in, first out" (FIFO).
#### You can imagine a queue as people in line at a store. The first person to stand in line will be served first, and the last person to stand in line will be served last.

The main operations with a queue are:
- `empty` — check if the queue has elements,
- `enqueue` (insertion into the queue) — the operation of adding a new element,
- `dequeue` (removal from the queue) — the operation of removing an element,
- `size` — the operation of getting the number of elements in the queue.
