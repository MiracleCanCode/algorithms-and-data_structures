## `Deque (double-ended queue)` â€” a versatile data structure that represents a sequence of elements with two ends. Elements can be added or removed from both the front and the back of the structure.

### In general, it's something between a queue and a stack.

- Access to the front or back of the deque is `O(1)`
- Access to the middle of the deque is `O(n)`
- Elements can be removed from both ends
- Insertion of elements is possible at both ends

### Basic operations with a deque:
- `empty` - check if there are elements
- `pushBack` - insert a new element at the end
- `pushFront` - insert a new element at the front
- `popBack` - remove the element from the end
- `popFront` - remove the element from the front
