# A **linked list** is a dynamic data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next (or previous) node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require preallocated memory and can dynamically change in size.  

## 🔹 Types of Linked Lists  

1. **Singly Linked List**  
   - Each node contains **data** and a **pointer to the next node**.  
   - Access to elements is **only in one direction**.  
   - The last node points to `NULL`, marking the end of the list.  

2. **Doubly Linked List**  
   - Each node stores **two pointers**: one to the **next** node and one to the **previous** node.  
   - Allows traversal in **both directions**.  

3. **Circular Linked List**  
   - The last node points back to the **first node**, forming a **closed structure**.  
   - Can be either **singly** or **doubly linked**.  

## 🔹 Operations on a Linked List  

### 1️⃣ Insertion  
- **At the beginning:** The new node becomes the head, pointing to the previous first node.  
- **At the end:** The last node is updated to point to the new node.  
- **In the middle:** The neighboring nodes update their pointers to include the new node in the chain.  

### 2️⃣ Deletion  
- **First element:** The head pointer is moved to the next node.  
- **Last element:** The second-to-last node’s pointer is set to `NULL`.  
- **Any element:** The previous node is updated to point to the node after the deleted one.  

### 3️⃣ Search  
- A **linear traversal (`O(n)`)** is performed until the desired element is found.  

## 🔹 Advantages and Disadvantages  

✅ **Pros:**  
- Flexibility: **dynamic size adjustment**.  
- Efficient **insertion and deletion (`O(1)`, if the node is known)**.  
- No need to **shift elements** as in arrays.  

❌ **Cons:**  
- **Slower access to elements (`O(n)`, compared to `O(1)` in arrays)**.  
- **Additional memory overhead** due to pointers.  

## 🔹 Where is it Used?  
- **Memory management** (e.g., OS allocators).  
- **Queue, stack, and hash table implementations**.  
- **Browser history navigation**.  
- **Task scheduling in operating systems**.  

## 🔹 Conclusion  
A linked list is a useful data structure, especially in scenarios where insertions and deletions are frequent. However, for fast random access, arrays are generally preferred. The choice depends on the specific problem and performance requirements.
