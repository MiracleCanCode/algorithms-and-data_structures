An **array** is a data structure that represents a collection of elements of the same type, stored sequentially in memory. Each element of the array has its index, which allows direct access to it. In most programming languages, array indexing starts at zero.

### 1. **Fixed size**
   - The size of the array is usually defined when it is created and does not change during runtime (unless a dynamic array is used, like in Python or Java).
   - This means that you need to know in advance how many elements will be in the array.

### 2. **Homogeneity of data**
   - All elements of the array must be of the same type (for example, all integers, strings, etc.).
   - This simplifies operations with arrays, as you can predict how much memory will be required to store each element.

### 3. **Sequential storage**
   - All elements of the array are stored sequentially in memory. This allows efficient use of cache memory and reduces data access time.

### 4. **Index-based access**
   - Access to any element of the array occurs in **constant time O(1)**, provided the index is known. This is one of the key features of arrays.

### 5. **Asymptotic complexity of operations**
   - **Access (by index)**: O(1) — access to any element of the array occurs in constant time because elements are stored consecutively in memory.
   - **Adding an element to the end (if the array size is fixed)**: O(1) — if the size of the array is known in advance and there is space for a new element, the addition is fast.
   - **Adding an element to the end (for a dynamic array)**: O(1) — if the array dynamically grows (for example, in Python where lists are used), the addition of an element takes O(1) time on average, but if memory needs to be reallocated, the operation may take O(n) time (where n is the current size of the array).
   - **Removing an element**: O(n) — if an element needs to be removed from anywhere other than the end of the array (for example, from the middle), all elements after the removed one must be shifted left by one position. Therefore, the removal operation takes O(n) time.
   - **Searching for an element**: O(n) — if we search for an element by value (not by index), in the worst case, we will have to go through all the elements of the array.
   - **Changing an element**: O(1) — changing the value of an element by index also occurs in constant time.

### 6. **Memory**
   - Arrays occupy a block of memory that depends on the number of elements and the type of data stored in them. For example, an array of 10 integers will occupy more memory than an array of 10 characters.

### 7. **Implementation**
   - In some languages, arrays can be implemented as fixed blocks of memory, while in others (e.g., Python or JavaScript), arrays are implemented as dynamic structures that can change their size during program execution.

### 8. **Disadvantages**
   - **Array size cannot be changed** (unless it's a dynamic array): If enough memory was not allocated in advance, it could lead to a lack of space for new elements.
   - **Difficulty in adding/removing elements in the middle**: If you need to insert or remove an element from the middle of an array, it requires shifting all subsequent elements, which takes O(n) time.

### 9. **Applications**
   - Arrays are ideal for cases where fast access to elements by index is needed, and the size of the array is known in advance.
   - They are used to implement various algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) and other data structures, such as stacks or queues.

### Summary table of asymptotic complexities:

| Operation                      | Time (Complexity) |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Access by index                | O(1)              |
| Changing an element            | O(1)              |
| Searching for an element by value | O(n)              |
| Adding to the end of the array  | O(1) (for dynamic arrays) or O(n) (for static arrays) |
| Removing an element             | O(n)              |
| Inserting an element in the middle | O(n)            |
